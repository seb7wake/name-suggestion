# name-suggestion

This is a name suggestion textbox created using the OpenAI API and Elasticsearch. The OpenAI API fetches new names and will save these nmaes in our Elasticsearch database. I then use Elasticsearch to suggest name s in real-time as the user types in the textbox.

This was a simple and fun project that I was motivated to do because of the recent uproar Chat-GPT3 is causing!
